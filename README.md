# Video Game Recommendations


*By Nadine Amersi-Belton*

## Problem statement

As a (hypothetic) junior data scientist at Steam, my role involves drawing insights from data and creating data-driven tools to boost sales and revenue. 

Firstly, I have been tasked with **providing useful recommendations for the marketing team**, who are currently reviewing their avertising contracts with various publishers.

As a second component, I have been asked to **build a user recommendation engine** using collaborative filtering methods to incentivise purchases. Steam (hypothetically) currently uses a content based model to genereate recommendations and is keen to see which method performs better.

Finally, I will be looking at **item-to-item recommendations**, providing similar items which can be listed on a game's page.

## Components

* **Jupyter Notebooks**

Jupyter Notebooks are our key deliverables and contain preprocessing, exploration and modelling. The Jupyter Notebook [0_Master_Notebook](https://github.com/nadinezab/video-game-recs/blob/master/0_Master_Notebook.ipynb) should be viewed first and contains links to the other notebooks.

* **Presentation**

The presentation gives a high-level overview of our approach, findings and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. It is aimed to be between 5 and 10 minutes long.

* **Data**

The data was obtained from https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#steam_data

* **Ressources**

A collection of [helper functions](https://github.com/nadinezab/video-game-recs/blob/master/resources.py) defined in the project and saved in `resources.py` for future use.

* **Blog Post**

A [blog post](https://nadinezab.medium.com/visualising-embeddings-with-t-sne-b54bf6b635f?sk=4606e6721bb5406e09943e4221f104dc) on Medium was created as part of this project.
